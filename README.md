## Overview

IdeaForge is a full-stack web application designed to connect people who have problems with people who have ideas, expertise, and problem-solving abilities.

The platform allows users to post real-world challenges and receive multiple community-driven solutions. Contributors can submit solutions, collaborate with others, improve existing ideas, and help surface the best solutions through voting and engagement.

Unlike traditional discussion forums, IdeaForge focuses on structured problem-solving. It is not just about asking questions or chatting. It is about collecting, evaluating, ranking, and refining ideas in a transparent and collaborative way.

The project was built as part of HackVision 2026 by Team ByteKarma.

## Problem Statement

Many individuals, startups, organizations, and communities face real-world challenges but often lack access to a wide range of expertise.

At the same time, many talented individuals have innovative ideas and skills but do not have a structured place to apply them.

Existing platforms such as Reddit, StackOverflow, and Upwork only solve part of the problem:

* Reddit provides discussions but lacks structure and quality control.
* StackOverflow is mostly limited to technical questions.
* Upwork focuses on paid execution rather than idea generation.

IdeaForge bridges this gap by creating a collaborative ecosystem where people can:

* Post problems
* Receive multiple solutions
* Collaborate on ideas
* Improve existing solutions
* Rank the best approaches
* Reward meaningful contributions

## Final Thought

IdeaForge is not just another forum or discussion platform.

It is a structured innovation ecosystem where ideas are generated, improved, ranked, and transformed into actionable solutions.

If Upwork is where work gets done, IdeaForge is where the best way to do that work is discovered.
